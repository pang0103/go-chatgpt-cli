        "content": "The lifespan of a wild cat can vary significantly depending on the species and their environment. Small wild cats like the Black-footed cat or the Rusty-spotted cat have a lifespan of around 10-12 years in the wild while larger cats like lions, tigers, and leopards have a lifespan of around 10-15 years in the wild. However, in captivity, wild cats can live significantly longer due to better access to food, medical care, and fewer dangers. For example, some captive lions and tigers have been known to live up to 20-25 years."
