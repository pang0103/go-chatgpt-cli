Small wild cats like the Black-footed cat or the Rusty-spotted cat have a lifespan of around 10-12 years in the wild while larger cats like lions, tigers, and leopards have a lifespan of around 10-15 years in the wild. However, in captivity, wild cats can live significantly longer due to better access to food, medical care, and fewer dangers. For example, some captive lions and tigers have been known to live up to 20-25 years."

This means that when passing an argument to a function, a copy of the value is created and passed to the function rather than a reference to the original value. This can sometimes result in unexpected behavior when working with complex data structures such as slices and maps. However, Go provides pointers as a mechanism to work with memory addresses and access the original value directly if needed."

        "content": "Java is also a pass-by-value language, but it can appear to be pass-by-reference in certain scenarios. In Java, when an argument is passed to a method, a copy of the value is passed to the method. However, when it is a reference type, the copied value is a reference to the original object. This can give the impression of pass-by-reference, as changes to the object within the method can affect the original object outside the method. \n\nFor example, consider the following code:\n\n```\nclass Test {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      int x = 5;\n      increment(x);\n      System.out.println(x); // outputs 5\n   }\n\n   public static void increment(int n) {\n      n++;\n   }\n}\n```\n\nHere, `x` is passed to the `increment` method but remains unchanged outside of the method. This is because `int` is a primitive type and is passed by value.\n\nHowever, when working with reference types, the behavior is different. For example:\n\n```\nclass Test {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};\n      increment(arr);\n      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr)); // outputs [2, 3, 4]\n   }\n\n   public static void increment(int[] arr) {\n      for (int i = 0; i \u003c arr.length; i++) {\n         arr[i]++;\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, `arr` is modified inside the `increment` method and these changes are reflected outside of the method as well. This is because `arr` is a reference type and the copied value is a reference to the original array."
